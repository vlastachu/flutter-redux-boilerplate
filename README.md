# Flutter Redux Boilerplate README

Sometimes it’s difficult to start doing something from scratch and a boilerplate generator comes to your aid. 

`⌘+⬆+P` then find `Generate Flutter Redux Boilerplate`, choose folder, name, actions and state properties and all done.

For now it has support only for Fish Redux.
